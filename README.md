# opencode-federal-platform-pack

**OpenCode pack for platform engineering and federal-aligned assessment.** Evidence-based reviews, GitOps audits, FedRAMP/FISMA/NIST readiness checks, and pre-push quality enforcement.

**What we do:** We help teams assess repositories and platforms for federal compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST 800-53, DoD Zero Trust, DoD DevSecOps), run GitOps maturity audits, and enforce quality gates before push. All outputs are structured (JSON schemas)—no free-form reports. We require evidence citations and never claim certification.

## At a Glance

| What | Count |
|------|-------|
| **Commands** | 27 |
| **Agents** | 19 |
| **Skills** | 16 |
| **Schemas** | review-score, quality-gate, compliance-report |

**Focus:** Platform engineering, DevSecOps, federal compliance (FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST 800, DoD Zero Trust, DoD DevSecOps). Not a generic AI pack—evidence required, no certification claims.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LongTheta/opencode-federal-platform-pack.git
cd opencode-federal-platform-pack
npm install
npm run verify
```

**Use it:**
- **Plugin only** — Copy `federal-platform-enforcement.js` for governance (blocks secrets, warns on push).
- **Full pack** — Run OpenCode from this repo or copy `.opencode/` into your project.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for options.

## What This Pack Does

| Capability | How |
|------------|-----|
| **Repo assessment** | `/repo-assess` — Architecture, security, deployment readiness; structured scorecard |
| **Federal compliance** | `/federal-checklist` — NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, FISMA, DoD ZT, DoD DevSecOps mapping |
| **GitOps audit** | `/gitops-audit` — CI/CD, IaC, supply chain, observability maturity |
| **Quality gate** | `/quality-gate` — Pre-push check; blocks on secrets, :latest, missing review |
| **Discovery & design** | `/solution-discovery`, `/platform-design` — Requirements, constraints, architecture options |
| **Development workflow** | `/plan`, `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/security`, `/build-fix`, `/e2e`, etc. |

**Outputs:** Structured JSON (review-score, quality-gate, compliance-report). No free-form reports.

---

## Strengths

- **Federal alignment** — FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST 800-53, DoD ZT, DoD DevSecOps, DT&E Guidebook
- **Evidence-based** — File/config citations; flags missing evidence; no certification claims
- **Structured output** — review-score, quality-gate, compliance-report schemas; schema-valid samples
- **Enforcement** — Plugin blocks secrets; quality-gate blocks push on critical issues
- **Documentation** — Architecture, usage, troubleshooting, glossary, command matrix
- **CI/CD** — Lint, npm audit, verify, tests, schema validation in GitLab CI

---

## Federal Frameworks

Assessments align to these frameworks. Outputs use **readiness**, **gap**, **partial** — never "compliant" or "certified."

| Framework | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **FedRAMP** | Low/Moderate/High baselines; cloud authorization |
| **FISMA** | NIST RMF (800-37), security controls |
| **NIST SP 800-53** | Security and privacy controls (AC, AU, IA, SC, SI, CM, CP, IR, SA) |
| **NIST SP 800-53A** | Assessment procedures |
| **NIST SP 800-207** | Zero Trust Architecture |
| **DoD Zero Trust Strategy** | 7 pillars (incl. Automation and orchestration) |
| **DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals v2.5** | Supply chain, security-at-each-phase, pipeline |
| **Software DT&E in DevSecOps Guidebook** (Jan 2025) | DT&E planning, SAST/DAST/IAST, SCA, SBOM |
| **NIST SP 800-190** | Container Security |
| **NIST SP 800-171** | CUI protection |

## Enforcement & Guardrails

| Plugin | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Block** | `.env` read; dangerous bash; `git push` when `FEDERAL_PLATFORM_BLOCK_PUSH=1` |
| **Warn** | `git push`; secrets in edits |
| **Log** | Supply-chain reminder (Dockerfile, package.json, go.mod) |

**Quality-gate:** Fails on secrets, `:latest` in prod, missing security review for changes, missing docs for meaningful changes.

## How This Differs from Generic Packs

| Aspect | Generic | This pack |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Evidence | Often generic | File/config citations; flags missing evidence |
| Discovery | Jumps to implementation | Asks questions first; documents assumptions |
| Security | Optional | Plugin blocks; quality-gate blocks push |
| Output | Free-form | Structured schemas |
| Compliance | Vague | FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST, DoD; no certification claims |

## Inspiration & How We Differ from Everything Claude Code

This pack was inspired by [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) (ECC)—the agent harness performance optimization system for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and similar AI coding agents.

| Aspect | Everything Claude Code | This pack |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Scope** | General software development across many languages and frameworks | Platform engineering and federal compliance only |
| **Focus** | Harness performance, token optimization, memory, continuous learning, broad dev workflows | Repo assessment, federal checklist, GitOps audit, quality gate, solution discovery |
| **Skills** | 108+ skills (Django, Laravel, Spring Boot, frontend, backend, TDD, etc.) | 16 skills (well-architected, federal-platform-review, NIST, GitOps, supply-chain, container, DoD ZT, solution-discovery, observability, terraform-iac, cloud platform) |
| **Output** | Free-form; varies by command | Structured JSON only (review-score, quality-gate, compliance-report schemas) |
| **Compliance** | General security (OWASP, AgentShield) | FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST 800-53, DoD ZT, DoD DevSecOps—readiness mapping, no certification claims |
| **Evidence** | Not required | Required—file/config citations; missing evidence flagged |
| **Primary harness** | Claude Code (with Codex, OpenCode, and related clients) | OpenCode-first (optional project AI rules) |

**Use ECC when:** You need broad development workflows, multi-language support, and harness optimization. **Use this pack when:** You need federal compliance mapping, GitOps maturity audits, platform architecture reviews, or evidence-based readiness assessments for government/DoD work.

## Guardrails

- **Evidence required** — Recommendations cite files/configs; missing evidence flagged.
- **No certification claims** — Use "readiness," "gap," "partial."
- **Security blocks push** — Secrets, `:latest`, missing review block push.
- **Docs required** — Meaningful changes require documentation updates.
- **Tagging** — Cloud resources need environment, owner, cost center tags.
