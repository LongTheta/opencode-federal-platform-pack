# NIST Compliance Evaluation — federal-workload-app

**Repository**: `federal-workload-app`  
**Evaluation Date**: 2025-03-18  
**Evaluator**: NIST Compliance Evaluator

---

## 1. Executive Compliance Summary

The `federal-workload-app` repository contains Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure with EKS workloads. **Identity and network security** show moderate alignment with NIST 800-53; **data protection** has gaps (secrets in Parameter Store without rotation, no KMS CMK). **Logging and monitoring** are partially implemented (CloudWatch present; CloudTrail status inferred). **Container security** lacks image scanning in CI and some workloads run as root. **Configuration management** is strong (IaC, GitOps); **incident response** has minimal runbook evidence.

**FedRAMP Readiness Estimate**: **Moderate** — Remediation of identity (least privilege), data protection (secrets rotation, KMS), and container security (scanning, non-root) would move toward High.

**Top recommendations**: (1) Restrict IAM to least privilege, remove wildcards; (2) Migrate secrets to Secrets Manager with rotation; (3) Add image scanning and enforce non-root containers; (4) Document and implement runbooks; (5) Confirm CloudTrail and log retention.

## 4. Zero Trust Maturity Assessment

| Pillar | Maturity | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Identity** | Partial | IAM roles present; workload identity used; MFA not enforced (Missing Evidence) |
| **Device** | N/A | Not applicable (serverless/container workload) |
| **Network** | Partial | Private subnets; some 0.0.0.0/0; VPC endpoints for S3 (Observed) |
| **Application/Workload** | Partial | ECS task roles; broad permissions (Gap) |
| **Data** | Partial | TLS on ALB; default RDS encryption; secrets not rotated (Gap) |
| **Visibility & Analytics** | Partial | CloudWatch logs; alerting partial; CloudTrail status unclear |

**Overall Zero Trust maturity**: **Traditional** — Moving toward Target; identity and network micro-segmentation need improvement.

## 7. FedRAMP Readiness Estimate

**Estimate**: **Moderate**

**Rationale**:
- **Identity (AC, IA)**: Gaps in least privilege and MFA reduce readiness; workload identity present.
- **Network (SC)**: Private subnets and VPC endpoints support; 0.0.0.0/0 ingress is a gap.
- **Data (SC, IA)**: TLS present; encryption at rest default; secrets rotation and KMS CMK needed.
- **Logging (AU, SI)**: Partial; CloudTrail and retention must be confirmed.
- **Containers (800-190)**: Image scanning and non-root are required for Moderate.
- **Configuration (CM)**: Strong IaC and GitOps.
- **Incident Response (IR)**: Runbooks and linkage need development.

**Path to High**: Address P1 gaps (identity, secrets, scanning, root containers, SG); add CloudTrail and runbooks; then reassess.
